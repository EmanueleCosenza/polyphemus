## Generated Samples

The following are examples of short and long sequences generated by two separate models.

#### Short sequences (2-bars)
{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/samples/2bars/1.mp3" %}  

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/samples/2bars/2.mp3" %}  

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/samples/2bars/3.mp3" %}

#### Long sequences (16-bars)
{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/samples/16bars/1.mp3" %}  

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/samples/16bars/2.mp3" %}
